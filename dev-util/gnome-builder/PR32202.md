Might want to include libdex-0.3.1 in this PR as well.

Not sure how to create new dev-libs/libpeas slot

@flint2 - I've taken care of the libpeas reverse deps in regards to the SLOT (keeping it as 0 for the old libpeas).
Can you please rebase and update appropriately and perhaps summarize what any remaining concerns and issues are? Something about sysprof splitting? Anything else?

Changed dependency to use libpeas without slot.
I'm not sure about sysprof, mutter, gnome-builder and sysprof are working ok for me as is with this PR.

libpeas-2 still needs to be in a separate SLOT. The change here was that we don't slotmove old SLOT from SLOT=0 to SLOT=1. They need to be parallel-installable still, etc.

On this one I was referring to https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/32202#discussion_r1314997997

Yes, I've checked that comment.
I understand that we are OK with this libs:
```
% equery f sysprof-capture|grep lib64
/usr/lib64
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-capture-3.a
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/sysprof-capture-3.pc
/usr/lib64
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-capture-4.a
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/sysprof-capture-4.pc

% equery f sysprof|grep lib64 
/usr/lib64
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-6.so
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-6.so.6
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-6.so.6.0.0
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-memory-6.so
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-speedtrack-6.so
/usr/lib64/libsysprof-tracer-6.so
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/sysprof-6.pc

```

I added a `src_prepare()` to gnome-builder-44 to actually get it to compile for myself first as a baseline. I can't work on it more for today, so maybe you can meanwhile rebase again and include that change into 45 bump too. I also keyworded a bunch of these ~arm64 (so I could install them on my machine), so would also be helpful to include those in the bump now to not look like a `DroppedKeywords`.

Hopefully I can pick it up again tomorrow. Not having done the rebase isn't a blocker though, I will just take care of it myself in that case once I get back to working on this PR - it'd just be a little extra help.

Added back in https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/32202/commits/ef8507d1dad4e06d55efe628be2d70305e708a0e
I still don´t know what to do with libpeas:0, not sure if can be moved to :1 and also change all dependencies...

Moving to :1 is just busywork as per https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/32202#discussion_r1314964629 - and I've taken care of modifying all the libpeas-1 dependencies to depend on libpeas:0 explicitly already by now.
Now we add a parallel-installable libpeas SLOT=2 and that's that. One SLOT is `0`, the other is `2` and that's fine.
SLOT=0 will eventually go away as everything gets migrated to libpeas-2 over time.

Sorry, ended up too busy last weekend. Hopefully throughout this week or weekend.
Meanwhile, can you see about the QA bot issues? I think it just needs to be rebased on top of current ::gentoo to get the preparations about libpeas:0 SLOT dep visible to it, plus if I read this right your re-added libpeas:2 commit is last, while previous commits already depend on it, thus needs some commit reordering?

@flint2 ping re rebase for QA report

The QA warnings seem to be at least the following:
* libpanel "lost" ~arm64 keyword in your bump; the earlier version got keyworded after you started this PR and thus on bump is lost. It might be "lost" for some others too, but I would be putting these in on an ~arm64 box, so would take care of it as I wouldn't be able to even test it otherwise :-D
* libpeas[gjs] needs p.use.mask'ing in a few profiles (armv4, ia64, sparc). Might be a case for putting in wd40 "mixin" profile as the problem is that newer gjs needs newer spidermonkey which needs rust

I'm not sure about naming it USE=gjs yet either, but I'm not sure USE=javascript is going to be much better.

I can sort out the QA issues as I go too. I think at this point I'll cherry-pick things one by one to get the process started, as I seem unable to allocate sufficient time beforehand to deal with the whole PR at once and it keeps delaying.
